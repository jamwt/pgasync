                   Simple Wiki Example

Description
-----------

This wiki uses restructured text.  It's pretty minimal, but
it uses a db backend, and implements pgasync code in a scalable
way.

Requirements
------------

Beyond pgasync and its base requirements, the following are also
needed:

 * Nevow 0.3
 * docutils (recent version)

Running
-------

Execute setup.sh as the PostgreSQL database owner account (often
called 'postgres'), then run:

 twistd -noy wiki.py

and browse to http://localhost:8080/
